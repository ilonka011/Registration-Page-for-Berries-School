# Registration-Page-for-Berries-School
Registration Page with CSS Grid 

#Introduction 

In this project, I created a registration form that takes the user's first and last name, email address, password, course they wish to participate in and 
any questions/comments they might have. 

#Building Technique 

CSS Grid, semantic HTML, given colors, fonts and required/non-required fields for the input were used.

#Learning 

Through this project, I learned about the reset type of input. I also learned that the form can look very good when grid is being used. 

#Goals 

I am planning to learn more about all the types of input and the details on them. I want to expand my knowledge as well as improve my skills on CSS in 
general.
